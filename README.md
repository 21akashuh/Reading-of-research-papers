Important papers in the field of deep learning

It very important to read the research paper, understand the basics, what is happening in the feild of deep learning, what are the applications, how can one enhance the current techinques to obtain the best results.

The papers are collected from various resources. 
1. IEEE digital library
2. ACM digital library
3. Various conferences

There are 30 research papers, which I consider important in understanding of machine learning, deep learnng and few neural networks,for which I made my summary on these papers.
